# RISCVJAM
Experimental Python-based RISC-V MP3 player concept using a Milk-V Duo / LuckFox Pico (64MB ideally, but most likely 256MB for extra headroom), an iPod clickwheel/case and either a 2-inch ST7789V-based SPI display with an HDMI redirect or a 2-inch Adafruit composite-based LCD.

Based loosely on code from the Retro iPod Spotify Project, but intended as an always-offline music player.

## Hardware:
- Milk-V Duo 256MB / LuckFox Pico Max - $15
- 2" display (either composite or SPI) - $15-$25
- MicroSD card (2GB or higher recommended) + microSD extender - $5-$15
- iPod case + functioning clipwheel (N/A)
- 8-pin FPC cable breakout board (for clickwheel) ($10)
- Battery or power source of some type. (TBD)

- Total cost: $60-$70(?)-ish
