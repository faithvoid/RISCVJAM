# RISCVJAM
Experimental Python-based RISC-V MP3 player concept using a Milk-V Duo (64MB ideally, but most likely 256MB for extra headroom), an iPod clickwheel/case and either a 2-inch ST7789V-based SPI display with an HDMI redirect or a 2-inch Adafruit composite-based LCD.

Based loosely on code from the Retro iPod Spotify Project, but intended as an always-offline music player.

## Hardware:
- Milk-V Duo 256MB
- 2" display (either composite or SPI)
- MicroSD card (2GB or higher recommended) + microSD extender
- iPod case + functioning clipwheel
- 8-pin FPC cable breakout board (for clickwheel)
- Battery or power source of some type.
