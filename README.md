# RISCVJAM
Experimental Python-based RISC-V MP3 player concept using a Milk-V Duo (64MB ideally, but most likely 256MB for extra headroom), an iPod clickwheel/case and either a 2-inch ST7789V-based SPI display with an HDMI redirect or a 2-inch Adafruit composite-based LCD.

Based loosely on code from the Retro iPod Spotify Project, but intended as an always-offline music player.
